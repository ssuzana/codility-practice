A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.
The leader of this array is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of A.
An equi leader is an index S such that 0 â‰¤ S < N - 1 and two sequences A[0], A[1], ..., A[S] 
and A[S + 1], A[S + 2], ..., A[N - 1] have leaders of the same value.

For example, given array A=[4,3,4,4,4,2] we can find two equi leaders:
0, because sequences: (4) and (3, 4, 4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
2, because sequences: (4, 3, 4) and (4, 4, 2) have the same leader, whose value is 4.
The goal is to count the number of equi leaders.
